"Triverse" was developed in 2023 as a project proposed by the company Magalu in partnership with FIAP. The project's goal was to create a casual game that could be played on Magalu's e-commerce sites. This game also needed to be simple, original, fun, and easy to learn. Triverse was chosen as the 2nd best game of the year and was developed by a group of 3 people.

The Unity Store asset "TopDown Engine" was used in the development.
